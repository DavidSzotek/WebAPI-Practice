# WebAPI-Practice
My first, complete REST API made using ASP.NET 8, EntityFrameworkCore without following a tutorial.

This API project will:
- Be made with Code First approach.
- Store information about different types of printers, materials and compatibility between them.
- Store information about manufacturers of those printers (contact)
- Store information about types of those materials (toner, drum, tranfer belt, etc. )
- Store information about the functionality of printers (multifunction, copier, scanner, printer, etc.)
- Include controllers for Action Methods for all Models with usage of DTOs
