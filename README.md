# WebAPI-Practice
My first, complete REST API made using ASP.NET 8, EntityFrameworkCore.

This API project will:
- Be made with Code First approach.
- Be made with asynchronous code.
- Store information about: different types of printers, materials and compatibility between them.
                           locations of those printers
                           number of different materials available in each warehouse
                           manufacturers of those printers (contact)
                           types of those materials (toner, drum, tranfer belt, etc. )
                           the functionality of printers (multifunction, copier, scanner, printer, etc.)
                           
- Include controllers for Action Methods for all Models with usage of DTOs & LINQ
- Maybe at later stages Authorization & Authentication will be added
